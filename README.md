#### Installation
In this project, I used **Python 3** to write a code to analyze the dataset.
To do the EDA and Modeing, these library are been installed:
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
 - [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
 - [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
 - [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
 - [Ipython](https://ipython.org/)
 
I used [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for this project

### Project Motivation

*Chicago* is is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Illinois, and the third-most-populous city in the United States. It is a destination of many tourist around the world. Also, it is knwon with its high crime rate. *Chicago's* crimes rate is heigher than the U.S. average rate. Therefore, it is important to study the crime status in the city in order to minimize it. In other words, it is a beautiful city and we want to keep it save.

### Data
 For this project, I used [Chicago Crimes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/crimes-in-chicago?select=Chicago_Crimes_2012_to_2017.csv)  form [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) to answer the three question, which are:
 
   1- Are crimes in Chicago seasonal?
  
   2- What are the most frequent crimes in Chicago?
   
   3- What the community areas have the highest rate of crimes in Chicago?
 
 ### File Descriptions
 1- [Crimes In Chicago Cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/ahlampdx/ChicagoCrimes/blob/master/Crimes%20In%20Chicago%20Cleaning.ipynb): a code to clean the dataset from missing data, outliers, duplicates and so on. 
 
 2- [Crimes in Chicago EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/ahlampdx/ChicagoCrimes/blob/master/Crimes%20in%20Chicago%20EDA.ipynb): This file has a code to explore the data
 
3- [Crimes in Chicago Modeling.ipynb](https://github.com/ahlampdx/ChicagoCrimes/blob/master/Crimes%20in%20Chicago%20Modeling.ipynb) : This file has a code to model the dataset
 
 
 ### Result
 
From questions above, we can conclude that crimes in Chicago increase as the peopleâ€™s outdoor activities increase. Also, most frequent crimes are the ones related to streets. Finally, the most of crimes happened on the west side of Chicago.
